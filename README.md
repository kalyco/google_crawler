## Google Image Crawler


### For getting you some many images at once.

Do you need a hundred or so images for whatever category?
This is a small, quick script for saving a google search image grab. 

My use case for it was for getting a collection of custom images to build a neural networks, but there is a huge range of applications, like accruing a variety of architecture-themed backgrounds, or printing a bunch of dinosaur images for a birthday party or whatever!

### Requirements

Python 3  
Selenium

Depending on the size, disk space isn't a huge concern, my images directory takes up 2.4mb, for example.
